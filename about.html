    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Christian Angelo Arciaga. Photography for me was a hobby that
      I turned into a career. I live in Ottawa, Canada. I do mostly event photography,
      and Portrait Photography. Since I was young, many people told me I was 
      an artist. As I grew older, I made peoples words into a reality. My portfolio
      showcases beautiful people with their beautiful stories.
